Through open innovation with creative communities, we support the innovation process for products, services, and business models. Our services are divided into 3 categories: &#8220;Learn&#8221;, &#8220;Create&#8221;, and &#8220;Share&#8221;. Under these 3 categories, we can combine and customize our services to meet your exact goals and needs. In addition, we&#8217;re developing a platform to connect individuals to creative communities.<br />

<strong>What are creative communities?</strong><br />
<p>Creative communities are communities centered around various topics such as art/design, technology/science, film/music, traditional crafts, fashion, food, construction, and social movements. These communities produce new value in these topic areas that can influence people&#8217;s values and lifestyles.</p>

Over the past few years, the global financial crisis and the Tohoku earthquake have forced uncertainty into the mindset of Japanese people. With the advancement of technology and the Internet, the world has become smaller, empowered individuals, and more so than any other period in history, increased the influence that a single individual&#8217;s statements and actions can have on the world.<br />
This shift is sparking a big change in individual awareness and values. Work styles, and even life styles, have become more diverse. With these changes, we believe that businesses will be expected to change the paradigm by which they offer their products and services.<br />
<br />
What is going to happen? To find out, we must dive head first into the change itself in order to experience first-hand the information and the perspectives that can&#8217;t be expressed in words. Without this critical experience, how would it be possible to truly produce the high quality output that society demands?<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>&#8220;OVT Service&#8221;</strong><br />
To address this need, we created OVT (On-the-Volunteer Training), a unique workforce development program that allows participants to acquire new perspectives, skills, and expand their network through volunteer activities in the community.<br />
On this program, participants will experience what they wouldn&#8217;t be able to learn through seminars or on-the-job training (OJT). They will get real work experience with a community while utilizing dialogue methodology and ethnographic approaches to challenge themselves to be innovative problem solvers.<br />
<br />
OVT doesn&#8217;t stop with workforce development. It is a strategic program that also focuses on ideas for new product/service development along with new business opportunities that result from these collaborations with communities.<br />
The primary OVT sites are communities in cities in Japan and Southeast Asia that engage in cultural or lifestyle issues.<br />

We believe that one of the biggest obstacles to innovation is an inability to incorporate a diverse set of values and ideas.<br />
With modern society undergoing rapid changes, shouldn&#8217;t organizations be incorporating simple ideas and knowledge from outside sources while promoting initiative, innovation, and collaboration internally? We also think that prototyping an idea within a community at an early stage and getting diverse feedback can lead to more practical innovations.<br />
<br />
We believe that including communities that engage in creating new value into the value chain can break down barriers within stagnant organizations and transform them into organizations that are better equipped to develop products and services from a novel perspective.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>&#8220;Community Design Service&#8221;</strong><br />
We provide support in creating communities both within and outside of organizations.<br />
To meet a variety of needs that include new product development, marketing, skill transfer, and user support, we provide a range of services that facilitate the community creation process. These include designing the community formation process, training core members, workshop design, team building, communication design, and the development of internal suggestion forms.<br />
<br />
<strong>&#8220;Community Management Service&#8221;</strong><br />
Whether it&#8217;s online or offline, we can revitalize pre-existing communities (both consumer-based and internal communities) by redesigning the communication processes and community objectives, and by managing the community.<br />

Often, a message will not resonate with its audience. For example, when you are walking down the street, looking at a magazine, watching TV, or browsing the Internet, how often do you see an advertisement that truly moves you to action? For us, at least, this is very rare. This is because most advertisements are of no interest to us and are simply seen as superficial sales messages.<br />
<br />
We believe that being transparent in our &#8220;actions&#8221; and their processes is a much simpler and more effective way to spread our message. Communicating our message to the community to which our audience belongs is also very important. If community members buy in to the message, they will spread it in their own words, allowing the message to travel from community to community and around the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>&#8220;Vision Sharing Service&#8221;</strong><br />
We provide a method for spreading a message via communities by designing the &#8220;action&#8221; for the desired message. Our design focuses around using events, software, social media, and video not as standalone tools, but rather focusing on them as points of &#8220;action&#8221; and using the most effective combination of these tools to spread the message.<br />

In a public opinion poll conducted by the Cabinet Office, over 60% of the population viewed volunteering as unpaid service or self-sacrifice. We plan to change this view of volunteering by offering a new perspective, OVT (On-the-Volunteer Training). In this view, volunteering is seen as an opportunity to acquire practical experience while gaining new perspectives, skills, expertise, and expanding your network. In other words, volunteering is not self-sacrifice but rather an opportunity for self-improvement.<br />
<br />
In order to provide opportunities for OVT, we are developing an OVT online platform to connect individuals with creative communities. We are introducing a system by which the curators can select creative communities from a variety of fields such as technology/science, design/art, and film/music which will stimulate the intellectual curiosity and creativity of the users. In doing so, we can sustain high quality communities. We are planning to alpha release in April 2013.<br />
<br />
<strong>&#8220;Societal Impact&#8221;</strong><br />
Only about 20% of the 20-30 age group volunteer compared to about 30% for other age groups. If we can just fill this 10% gap, that means that there will be 800,000 &#8211; 1,000,000 new volunteers. Since each volunteer works 22 days per year on average, this results in 17,600,000 &#8211; 22,000,000 more volunteer days. If you consider the web services, food/drink, and transportation costs necessitated by volunteer work, this could have an economic impact of several billion dollars. It wouldn&#8217;t be a stretch to say that a new economy known as the volunteer market could arise.<br />
<br />
<strong>&#8220;Possibilities for the Future&#8221;</strong><br />
・A potential creator or designer, who wants to work with talent but has no opportunity to demonstrate his ability, and thus cannot move ahead in his career.<br />
・An excellent foreign exchange student with great language skills, who wants to understand Japan on a deeper level but can&#8217;t join a community while here and ultimately goes back home.<br />
・A skilled retiree, who wants to participate in a meaningful activity not for money but to connect with others, but cannot find an opportunity to do so.<br />
<br />
OVT meets the needs of these people, and by connecting people to communities through action, the resulting trust that is developed can help to create new start ups and NPOs. In this way, we believe that we can create a culture of starting new businesses.<br />
